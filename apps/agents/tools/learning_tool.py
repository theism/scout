"""
Learning tool for the Scout data agent platform.

This module provides a factory function to create a tool that allows the agent
to save discovered corrections and patterns as AgentLearning records. These
learnings are automatically injected into future prompts via the KnowledgeRetriever,
enabling the agent to improve over time without retraining.

This implements the "GPU-poor continuous learning" pattern described in the
architecture - the agent learns from its mistakes and shares that knowledge
across all future conversations.

    Create a tool for saving agent learnings.

    The returned tool allows the agent to persist discovered corrections
    and patterns that will be automatically applied to future queries.
    This is the key mechanism for the agent's self-improvement capability.

    Learnings are stored with:
    - A plain English description (injected into future prompts)
    - The category of learning (for organization and retrieval)
    - The tables it applies to (for relevance filtering)
    - Original and corrected SQL (for reference and validation)

        workspace: The TenantWorkspace model instance for scoping the learning.
        user: The User model instance who triggered the conversation
              where the learning was discovered.

    Returns:
        A LangChain tool function that saves learnings.

    Example:
        >>> tool = create_save_learning_tool(workspace, user)
        >>> result = tool.invoke({
        ...     "description": "The events.timestamp column stores epoch ms, not a timestamp",

        Save a learned correction for future queries.

        Call this tool AFTER you have successfully corrected a query error.
        The learning will be automatically applied to future queries,
        preventing the same mistake from happening again.

        Guidelines for good learnings:
        - Be specific and actionable
        - Include the exact fix, not just what was wrong
        - Reference specific column/table names
        - Explain WHY the fix works

        Good example:
        "The events.timestamp column stores Unix epoch milliseconds (not seconds).
        Use to_timestamp(timestamp / 1000.0) to convert to a PostgreSQL timestamp."

        Bad example:
        "The timestamp column was wrong."

        Args:
            description: Clear, actionable description of what was learned.
                Must be detailed enough that another agent (or future you)
                can apply this learning correctly. Include:
                - What was the problem
                - What is the correct approach
                - Any specific syntax or patterns to use

            category: Classification of the learning. Must be one of:
                - type_mismatch: Column type different than expected
                - filter_required: Query needs a specific WHERE clause
                - join_pattern: Correct way to join specific tables
                - aggregation: Gotcha with aggregation/grouping
                - naming: Column or table naming convention
                - data_quality: Known data issues (NULLs, duplicates, etc.)
                - business_logic: Domain-specific rules
                - other: Anything that doesn't fit above

            tables: List of table names this learning applies to.
                Future queries involving these tables will see this learning.
                Use actual table names from the schema.

            original_sql: The SQL that failed (optional but recommended).
                Helps validate the learning and provides context.

            corrected_sql: The SQL that worked (optional but recommended).
                Shows the correct pattern to follow.

        Returns:
            A dict with:
            - learning_id: UUID of the created learning (as string)
            - status: "saved" on success, "error" on failure
