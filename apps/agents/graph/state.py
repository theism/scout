"""
Agent state definition for Scout data agent platform.

This module defines the AgentState TypedDict that flows through the LangGraph
conversation graph. The state maintains conversation history, user context,
and error correction metadata needed for the agent's self-healing capabilities.

The state is designed to be:
- Serializable: All fields can be persisted to Postgres checkpoints
- Immutable: LangGraph manages state updates through reducers
- Type-safe: Full type hints for IDE support and runtime validation

    Prune old messages when the conversation gets too long.

    This function implements a message pruning strategy that:
    1. Always preserves system messages at the start
    2. Keeps the most recent N messages (default 20)
    3. Ensures we don't break tool call/response pairs

        >>> pruned = prune_messages(messages, max_messages=10)

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """
    State object that flows through the Scout agent graph.

    This TypedDict defines all the data that persists across conversation turns
    and gets checkpointed to the database. LangGraph uses this state to:
    - Track conversation history with automatic message deduplication
    - Maintain user and tenant context for permission scoping

    Attributes
    ----------
    messages : Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]
        The conversation history. Uses LangGraph's add_messages reducer
        which handles message deduplication by ID. Includes:
        - HumanMessage: User questions
        - AIMessage: Agent responses (may include tool calls)
        - ToolMessage: Results from tool execution (SQL results, errors)
        - SystemMessage: Dynamic context injection

    workspace_id : str
        UUID of the current workspace. Injected into every MCP tool call so tools
        can route to the correct schema (single-tenant or view schema for multi-tenant).

    user_id : str
        UUID of the current user (as string for serialization).
        Used for audit logging and permission checks.

    user_role : str
        The user's role within this project. Controls:
        - 'viewer': Read-only access, no data modifications
        - 'analyst': Can run queries and create artifacts
        - 'admin': Full access including knowledge management

    Example
    -------
    Initial state for a new conversation::

        state = AgentState(
            messages=[],
            workspace_id="ws-uuid-123",
            user_id="user-123",
            user_role="analyst",
        )

    Notes
    -----
    - The add_messages annotation is critical: it enables LangGraph's
      automatic message list management with deduplication by message ID.
    - All UUID fields are stored as strings because TypedDict values
      must be JSON-serializable for checkpoint persistence.
